# printf

The printf function prints a message to the screen using a "format string" that includes instructions for mixing multiple strings into the final string to be displayed on the screen.


## Usage

```c
import printf

# returns 'words'
printf('words')

# returns 'geese'
printf('geese')

# returns 'phenomenon'
printf('phenomenon')
```

## What we did

Writes the C string pointed by format to the standard output.
